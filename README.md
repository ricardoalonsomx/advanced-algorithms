# Analysis and Design of Advanced Algorithms
This repository includes homeworks from the [Analysis and Design of Advanced Algorithms](https://samp.itesm.mx/Materias/VistaPreliminarMateria?clave=TC2017&lang=ES#) 
(subject of Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey). All of the code in this repository is authored solely by me. Due to collaboration with a team partner in some cases, only 7 out 
of the 10 homework assignments are included:

1. [Longest palindrome algorithm](/longest-palindrome-algorithm/)
2. [Kruskal minimum spanning trees](/kruskal-minimum-spanning-trees/)
3. [Prim's minimum spanning trees](/prim-minimum-spanning-trees/)
4. [Floyd's Warshall shortest-path](/floyd-warshall-shortest-path/)
5. [Ford's Fulkerson maximum flow](/ford-fulkerson-maximum-flow/)
6. [Convex hull](/convex-hull/)
7. [Shape Context](/shape-context/)
